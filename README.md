##About The Project
DRNKSCL is a social-platform that allows users to share <br>
and exchange cocktail recipes.


###Built With 
- Core Java
- Spring Boot
- HTML
- CSS/ Bootstrap
- Javascript/ AJAX.


The backend was built using Spring Boot due to its 
highly flexible, quick-to-start nature.<br>
AJAX was used to facilitate database updates in an <br>
aynchronous manner. A relational database was implemented via MySQL <br>
to facilitate multi-row transactions. The front end was built using <br>
Bootstrap due to its clean, simple layout. <br>
Although there were no particular challenges, we hope to implement <br>
more features to enahnce user-to-user interactions. Among features <br>
to be implemented include user messaging, user cocktails reveiws, <br>
and allowing users to 'follow' or 'befriend' each other.
